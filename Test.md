# LOST IN THE ENCHO

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]

You were that foundation
Never gonna be another one, no
I followed, so taken
So conditioned, I could never let go
Then sorrow, then sickness
Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow, so vicious
So afraid, I couldn't let myself see
(Oh-oh-oh) That I could never be held
Back or up, no, I hold myself
Check the rep, yep, you know mine well
Forget the rest, let them know my Hell
(Oh-oh-oh) There and back, yet my soul ain't sell
Kept respect up, the best, they fell
Let the rest be the tale they tell
That I was there, sayin'
